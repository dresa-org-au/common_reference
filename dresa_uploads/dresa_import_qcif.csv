Working with Sensitive Data,https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/276304563387/,"""This workshop uses practical and discussion-based training to guide researchers about identifying what constitutes sensitive data, the risks of working with sensitive data, and how to appropriately manage those risks. It covers the “Five Safes” framework and researchers’ responsibilities, and introduces ways to promote data security and mitigate disclosure risks.""",20220404T090000,20220404T110000,AEST,training@qcif.edu.au,QCIF,open_to_all;,QCIF,true,,,
Data Storytelling,https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/291084059257/,"""Research communication is much more than just writing journal papers; to maximise the impact of your work, it’s vital that you make your research findings accessible and engaging to a wide audience. Data storytelling is a powerful way achieving this, by conveying your ideas in a clear and memorable way. This interactive webinar focuses on developing your data storytelling skills by introducing a range of data visualisation techniques that you can use to combine the three elements of data, visuals and narrative into a meaningful and memorable story. By using these three elements, you can weave a story about your research for an array of audiences, in a way that they will connect with and remember.""",20220511T133000,20220511T153000,AEST,training@qcif.edu.au,QCIF,open_to_all;,QCIF,true,,,
A Guide to Reproducible Research,https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/292221290747/,"""The idea that you can duplicate an experiment and get the same conclusion is the basis for all scientific discoveries. Reproducible research is data analysis that starts with the raw data and offers a transparent workflow to arrive at the same results and conclusions. However not all studies are replicable due to lack of information on the process. Therefore, reproducibility in research is extremely important. Researchers genuinely want to make their research more reproducible, but sometimes don’t know where to start and often don’t have the available time to investigate or establish methods on how reproducible research can speed up every day work. We aim for the philosophy “Be better than you were yesterday”. Reproducibility is a process, and we highlight there is no expectation to go from beginner to expert in a single workshop. Instead, we offer some steps you can take towards the reproducibility path following our Steps to Reproducible Research self paced program.""",20220525T133000,20220525T150000,AEST,training@qcif.edu.au,QCIF,open_to_all;,QCIF,true,,,
